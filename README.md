# Java-Basics

    Repository to store implementation on basic concepts of Java

## Purpose of this repository

I started learning Android development. But because I left Java practice almost 3years back from 2021. I had to do some revisions to
become comfortable with Java programming concepts again, I followed a udemy tutorial: [like here](https://www.udemy.com/course/androidappcourse/)

In the process, I also learned and implemented techniques from myself. Those are also listed here.

## Which IDE to use?

I was asked this particula question a many times. Since I was in school and was coding with Java, I used Blue-J. But a lot has changed since then. Now most people are using IntelliJ-IDE.

There's reason to use this.

    Ever bored writing `System.out.println();` or `System.out.print();` or `Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);` ?

If yes, then checkout intellij's live template. I have configured it to write ``Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);`` for `input` and `soup` writes me `System.out.print();`. And many other live templates, that I created and customized.

*So answer is Intellij*

## How long will this repository be maintained?

As long as I am practicing Java and there'll be lots of updates everyday, if I choose **Android Development** as my carrer path.
